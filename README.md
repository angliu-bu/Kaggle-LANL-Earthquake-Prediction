Kaggle Compitition LANL Earthquake Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction

Hi,

In this competition, we will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, Weâ€™ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data.

I extracted different features from acoustic data and built LightGBM and XGBoost models to predict the time to the next earthquake happen.
